# How To Fall Stuck Into Backend Web Development With Node.js

This book is designed for people who want to learn about backend web application development with Node.js.

Here, I will introduce you to some scenarios that occur in the real world.

By following this guide, you will be able to fully understand why we are doing it and the purpose behind it.

And there will be no more "WTH am I doing right now?!"

We will start with a very simple example.

Well... No more talking. Let's have some fun!

## Scenario

You are running a Baby Hospital and need a system to manage all the babies's information.

Currently, you are the only employee and boss.

So you need to do anything everything by yourself!

It means that you are fully responsible for everything that happens in this baby hospital.

And because you are the only one for now, so the system...

* Won't require any authentication FOR NOW.
* WILL run on your local machine FOR NOW.
* Those things mean the system WILL BE VERY INSECURE FOR NOW.
* But we will deal with that later.

BTW, You have already hired someone to finish the GUI.

So you just need to finish backend to make the system work.
