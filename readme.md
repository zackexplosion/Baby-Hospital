# How To Fall Stuck Into Backend Web Development With Node.js

This is a book design for people who want to learn about backend web applications development with Node.js.

In here, I will introduce you some scenarios which happen in the real world.

By following this guide, you will able to fully understand why we are doing it and What is the purpose of it.

And there shall be no more "WTH am I doing right now!?"

We are starting from a very simple example.

Well....No more talking. Let's have some fun!

## Scenario

You are running a Baby Hospital and you want to have a system that manage all baby's information.

Currently, you are the only one employee and boss.

So you need do anything all by yourself!

It means that you are fully responsible for everything that happens in this baby hospital.

And because you are the only one for now, so the system...

* Won't require any authentication FOR NOW.
* WILL run on your local machine FOR NOW.
* Those things means the system WILL BE VERY INSECURE FOR NOW.
* But we will deal with that later.

BTW, You already hired someone to finished the GUI.

So you just need to finish backend to make the system works.
