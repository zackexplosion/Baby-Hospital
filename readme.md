We are starting from a very simple example.

Well....No more talking. Let's get some fun!

## Scenario

You are running a Baby Hospital and you want to have a system that can manage all baby's information.

Currently, you are the only one employee and boss man.

So you need do anything by yourself!

Which means you are full responsible for ANYTHING to yourself!.

And because you are the only one for now, so the system...

* Won't require any authentication FOR NOW.
* WILL run on your local machine FOR NOW.
* Those things means the system WILL BE VERY INSECURITY FOR NOW.
* But we will deal with that later.

BTW, You already hired someone to finished the GUI.
