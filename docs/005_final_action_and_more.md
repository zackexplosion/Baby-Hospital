# Final Action And More!

Now we going to finish the DELETE action which is the Final Action of the Chapter.

But before we doing anything, I want to discuss about the DELETE action.

So what is a DELETE action?

For now, you may think we just going to delete the record in Database just like UPDATE action.

But what if....someone or yourself delete a record accidentally?

If you just delete a record in Database

There is not way back!


## So, What's The "More" Part?
